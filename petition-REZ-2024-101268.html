    <p>
      (Deferred from the November 14, 2024, Meeting)<br><br>
REZ-2024-101268 Andrew M. Condlin for GEM Capital, LLC: Request to conditionally
rezone from A-1 Agricultural District and C-1 Conservation District to R-5AC General
Residence District (Conditional) on Parcel 832-727-2459 containing 65.95 acres located
on the north line of N. Washington Street approximately 150’ east of its intersection with
Delbert Drive. The applicant proposes a single-family subdivision. The use will be
controlled by zoning ordinance regulations and proffered conditions. The 2026
Comprehensive Plan recommends Suburban Residential 1, density should not exceed 2.4
units per acre, and Environmental Protection Area. Staff – Seth Humphreys (Deferral

    <p>
      This petition opposes the rezoning of agricultural land in Highland Springs to higher-density residential or commercial zoning. 
      We believe such changes threaten the rural character, strain infrastructure, and risk harming nearby wetlands and ecosystems.
      By signing below, you support maintaining the current agricultural zoning and preserving the quality of life in our community.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="petition-context">
    <p>
      We, the undersigned residents of Silver Spring Farms, Millie Farms, Greendale Park, and other surrounding neighborhoods, firmly oppose the proposed development of 120 homes on approximately 65.95 acres of land currently zoned Agricultural (A-1) and located off North Washington Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed rezoning to General Residential (R-5AC), allowing 2.4 homes per acre, would dramatically alter the rural character of our community, pose new or increased dangers, and allow for further developer invasion. Our area is defined by its agricultural heritage, open green spaces, protected wetlands, prime farmland of statewide importance, and its connection to the Chickahominy State Scenic River.
    </p>
    <p>
      We respectfully urge that any future development on this land be limited to a density of no more than one home per acre, zoned for A-1 Farmland and C-1 Conservation District, in alignment with the community's existing character and environmental priorities.
    </p>
